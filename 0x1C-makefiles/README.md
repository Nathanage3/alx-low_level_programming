A Makefile is a special file, used by the make utility, that guides the compilation and linking of programs in Unix and Unix-like environments. It is essentially a script containing a set of rules and dependencies used to automate the build process.

Key Components:
Targets: These are the names of the files to be created or actions to be executed.
Prerequisites: Files that need to be updated before a target can be processed.
Commands: Shell commands that create or update the target.
Features:
Efficiency: Only rebuilds parts of a program that have been modified.
Modularity: Allows for complex builds with less effort.
Customization: Enables detailed control over the compilation process.
Basic Structure:
makefile
Copy code
target: prerequisites
	commands
Indentation: Commands must be preceded by a tab, not spaces.
Example:
makefile
Copy code
all: program

program: main.o utils.o
	gcc -o program main.o utils.o

main.o: main.c
	gcc -c main.c

utils.o: utils.c utils.h
	gcc -c utils.c
Usage:
Run make to execute the first target in the Makefile.
Run make [target] to build a specific target.
Advantages:
Automates and simplifies the build process.
Reduces the risk of human error in repetitive build tasks.
Limitations:
Learning curve: Requires understanding of its syntax and rules.
Mostly used in Unix/Linux environments; less common in Windows.
Makefiles are a powerful tool in software development, especially for larger projects with many components. They offer a reliable and efficient way to manage complex build processes.
